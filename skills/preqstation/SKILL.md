  Fetch tasks from PREQSTATION, execute work, and push updates/results back to PREQSTATION APIs.
  Use when asked to run a PREQ task, fetch todo tasks, or update execution status.
  Prefer the remote MCP endpoint at /mcp with OAuth login. Shell helper mode still uses PREQSTATION_API_URL and PREQSTATION_TOKEN.
  Tasks carry an `engine` field (`claude-code` | `codex` | `gemini-cli`) indicating which AI agent should execute them.
---

This is the agent-side lifecycle skill. The OpenClaw launcher skill is separate and should be named `preqstation-dispatch`.

## Environment

Recommended MCP mode:

- Register the remote MCP endpoint from the PREQSTATION `projects-manager` service:
  - Claude Code: `claude mcp add -s user --transport http preqstation https://<your-domain>/mcp`
  - Codex: `codex mcp add preqstation --url https://<your-domain>/mcp`
  - Gemini CLI: `gemini mcp add --scope user --transport http preqstation https://<your-domain>/mcp`
- OAuth starts when the client first makes a real request to `/mcp`
- Codex often triggers login during `add` because it probes the server immediately
- Gemini CLI may also prompt for auth during MCP registration or first real tool call
- Claude Code usually stores the config first and may show `Needs authentication` until first use or `claude mcp get preqstation`
- Prefer one user-scoped Claude Code PREQ registration so you do not accumulate duplicate project-local entries
- Verify MCP registration with `claude mcp list`, `codex mcp list`, or `gemini mcp list`
- Complete the browser login flow when prompted by the client

Optional shell helper mode:

- `PREQSTATION_API_URL`: PREQSTATION API base URL (example: `https://mypreqstation.vercel.app`)
- `PREQSTATION_TOKEN`: PREQSTATION Bearer token (generated in PREQSTATION `/api-keys`)
- `PREQSTATION_ENGINE` (optional): fallback engine (`claude-code` | `codex` | `gemini-cli`) when client auto-detection is unavailable

## Agent Identity & Engine Mapping

Each agent must identify itself and use the corresponding `engine` value in **all** task operations (list, create, plan, start, update status, complete, review, block):

| If you are...        | Use `engine=` |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Claude (Anthropic)   | `claude-code` |
| GPT / Codex (OpenAI) | `codex`       |
| Gemini (Google)      | `gemini-cli`  |

Always include your `engine` value when listing, creating, planning, starting, completing, reviewing, or blocking tasks.

Gemini CLI workers can run interactively with `gemini` or headless with `gemini -p "<prompt>"`.
If your installed Gemini environment does not expose remote HTTP MCP, use the shell helper fallback instead of this MCP path.

## MCP Plugin Mode (Recommended)

If MCP is available, prefer the remote `/mcp` endpoint exposed by the PREQSTATION service.
All mutation tools accept an optional `engine` parameter and always send an engine value using this order:

1. explicit tool arg
2. existing task engine (when available)
3. MCP `initialize.clientInfo.name` auto-detection
4. `PREQSTATION_ENGINE`
5. `codex` fallback

| Tool                        | engine usage                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `preq_list_projects`        | Read-only, no engine needed (list PREQ projects for setup and local repo mapping)                                   |
| `preq_list_tasks`           | Read-only, no engine needed                                                                                          |
| `preq_get_task`             | Read-only, no engine needed                                                                                          |
| `preq_get_project_settings` | Read-only, no engine needed (fetch project deploy settings by key)                                                   |
| `preq_update_qa_run`        | Read-only from task lifecycle perspective; updates branch-level QA run status/report without task transitions        |
| `preq_plan_task`            | Assign `engine`, send lifecycle action `plan`, backend moves inbox task to `todo` and clears `run_state`             |
| `preq_create_task`          | Assign `engine` to new inbox task                                                                                    |
| `preq_start_task`           | Record `engine` claiming the task; backend marks `run_state=working`                                                 |
| `preq_update_task_note`     | Record `engine` while replacing the task note markdown without changing workflow status                              |
| `preq_update_task_status`   | Record `engine` while updating workflow status-only endpoint (`/api/tasks/:id/status`)                               |
| `preq_list_dispatch_requests` | Read-only; inspect explicit dispatch requests used by launcher runtimes for ask parity and project-level insight |
| `preq_update_dispatch_request` | Launcher runtime only; mark an explicit dispatch request as `dispatched` or `failed` after launch succeeds or fails |
| `preq_complete_task`        | Record `engine` in work log result, send lifecycle action `complete`; backend moves → `ready` and clears `run_state` |
| `preq_review_task`          | Record `engine` running verification, send lifecycle action `review`; backend moves → `done` and clears `run_state`  |
| `preq_block_task`           | Record `engine` reporting the block, send lifecycle action `block`; backend moves → `hold` and clears `run_state`    |
| `preq_delete_task`          | Permanently delete a task by ticket number or UUID                                                                   |

This gives deterministic task-id based execution and result upload.

## Execution Flow (Mandatory)

You must follow this execution flow exactly.
Do not skip, reorder, combine, or substitute lifecycle actions.
PREQ launcher-driven runs are non-interactive by default.
You may use process skills such as `brainstorming` or `writing-plans` only as internal guidance while continuing the PREQ lifecycle in the same run.
Do not stop to ask the user for approval, clarifications, or design feedback mid-run unless PREQ tools are unavailable or the prompt/worktree/task state is invalid.

Load -> Initialize -> Execute -> Finalize

1. Load:
   Load the `.preqstation-prompt.txt` in this worktree/branch

2. Initialize:

- When Task ID is present, MUST call `preq_get_task` once at the start to fetch task details, acceptance criteria, workflow status, `run_state`, and the initial engine.
- If `preq_get_task` returns `latest_preq_result`, read it before substantive work and treat it as previous execution context, especially for resumed or previously blocked tasks.
- When Task ID is present and the task is active, MUST call `preq_start_task`.
- When Task ID is absent for project-level objectives such as `insight`, skip task lifecycle reads/writes and treat the prompt metadata plus project key as the source of truth.
- In `debug` mode, create or refresh `preqstation-progress.md` after `preq_get_task` and update it after each major checkpoint.
- Resolve the task-facing content language once near the start of the run by inspecting the current task note and any temporary trailing `Ask:` helper block first, then acceptance criteria, and only using the task title as a weak tie-breaker.
- Use the dominant language of that note-centric task content for PREQ-facing written updates such as plan markdown, rewritten task notes, completion summaries and notes, review notes, block reasons, QA reports, and newly created task content.
- Use project `agent_instructions` only as a final tie-breaker when the task note, `Ask:` block, and acceptance criteria are still mixed or ambiguous. The current task content takes precedence.
- If no dominant language is clear, default PREQ-facing written updates to English.

3. Execute the user objective
   user objective is in the `.preqstation-prompt.txt`

- If user objective start with `plan`:
  - Start to plan using the local code.
  - Planning means plan generation only. You may inspect local code, but you must not implement product changes, run deploy steps, or run tests, build, lint, or other verification commands.
  - Before blocking for missing code, inspect the primary checkout as well as the current worktree. If the worktree is in a bootstrap repo state, such as only `.gitignore` being tracked, but the primary checkout contains the real app files, treat that as repo recovery rather than a missing project.
  - During bootstrap repo recovery, ensure `origin` exists and matches the PREQ repo URL. If `origin` is missing and the repo URL is known, add it with `git remote add origin <repo_url>`.
  - Commit the baseline project files on `main`, push `origin/main`, recreate or refresh the worktree, and continue planning after the code becomes inspectable.
  - Block the run only when the primary checkout is the wrong repo, the repo URL is unavailable or mismatched, or the bootstrap recovery push to `origin/main` fails.
  - Call `preq_plan_task` with plan markdown and implementation checklist.
  - Process skills are allowed only as internal guidance. This run must stay non-interactive and end at `preq_plan_task`.
- Else If user objective start with `ask`:
  - Rewrite or update the existing task note. Keep the workflow status unchanged.
  - Treat the current task note plus any temporary trailing `Ask:` helper block as the source material for the rewrite.
  - If the ask clearly requests a prototype or reviewable artifact, local artifact generation is allowed.
  - Artifact publishing is best-effort, but it is mandatory to attempt when a safe artifact provider is already available. Use the provider already authenticated in the current agent session; Fast.io is one supported provider, not the only valid target.
  - If the current agent already has an authenticated Fast.io MCP session or another authenticated provider, treat that provider as already available and attempt publication without waiting for extra provider instructions.
  - Durable artifact links must use a `private-or-skip` policy. Authenticated workspace targets, member-restricted shares, and registered-account shares count as acceptable private access. Skip non-expiring `anyone with the link` URLs or other public-link-only modes.
  - If the provider can create temporary external share or quickshare links, create 7-day expiring reviewer links for the published artifacts. Mark them with `access=quickshare` or the provider's equivalent and include `expires=...`; do not create non-expiring public links.
  - If the local artifact is an HTML prototype or HTML mockup, generate at least one screenshot PNG for review, then attempt to publish both the HTML source and screenshot artifact when an authenticated provider is available.
  - Record published links under an `Artifacts:` markdown block using lines like `- [image] Desktop screenshot | provider=fastio | access=quickshare | expires=2026-04-18T00:00:00Z | url=...` and `- [document] HTML prototype | provider=fastio | access=private-workspace | url=...`.
  - For prototype or reviewable artifact asks, record the artifact publishing result or skip reason in the note. If publishing is skipped, include the local artifact path and a concise reason such as provider unavailable, unauthenticated, or no safe target.
  - Treat localhost and `127.0.0.1` URLs as local-only diagnostics. Do not present them as the only review link; either publish a private artifact URL or explicitly mark the artifact as local-only with the skip reason.
  - Persist the rewritten markdown with `preq_update_task_note`, including any published artifact URLs or artifact publishing skip note.
  - Clear execution state by calling `preq_update_task_status` with the current workflow status from `preq_get_task`.
  - The final saved note must not include the temporary `Ask:` helper block.
- Else If user objective start with `insight`:
  - Task ID may be absent for this branch. Do not invent one and do not call task lifecycle mutations when no task exists.
  - Inspect the local project from the current worktree and use the provided Insight Prompt only as task-generation guidance.
  - Call `preq_list_tasks` with the current `projectKey` and `detail=full` before creating anything so you can avoid duplicates in `inbox`, `todo`, `hold`, and `ready`.
  - Create multiple Inbox tasks with `preq_create_task`.
  - Title each created task with a short shared topical prefix derived from the user intent or current work area.
  - Keep `description` detailed, but keep `acceptanceCriteria` to checklist-only verification items.
  - Do not mutate existing tasks and do not produce a long-form implementation plan instead of task creation.
- Else If user objective start with `qa`:
  - Task ID may be absent for this branch. Do not invent one and do not call task lifecycle mutations when no task exists.
  - Resolve `qa_run_id` from `.preqstation-prompt.txt` and use `preq_update_qa_run` to mark the run `running` as soon as the local target URL is known.
  - Resolve `qa_task_keys` from `.preqstation-prompt.txt` when present. If listed, call `preq_get_task` for each task key before browser testing and treat those tasks' titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria as the QA scope.
  - If the current agent has access to the `dogfood` skill, use it as the default QA workflow for browser testing and report generation.
  - Start the current project from the current worktree/branch, determine the local target URL, and run browser QA against that URL.
  - Limit QA to the scoped Ready tasks and the minimal navigation or sanity checks needed to reach and verify them. Do not expand into unrelated full-app exploratory QA. Report unrelated findings only when they block scoped verification or prevent the app from starting.
  - QA reports may include optional artifact references for screenshots, videos, and documents. Use the same `private-or-skip` policy when a safe provider is available.
  - If QA artifact publishing is skipped after generating local artifacts, record the artifact publishing result or skip reason in the final QA report.
  - When QA finishes, call `preq_update_qa_run` again with final status (`passed` or `failed`), `target_url`, markdown report, and summary counts.
  - Do not call `preq_complete_task`, `preq_review_task`, or `preq_block_task` unless this run is also handling a real PREQ task.
- Else If user objective start with `implement` or `resume`:
  - Implement code changes and run task-level tests.
  - If `latest_preq_result` is present, use it to understand the latest blocked reason, prior summary, and most recent PREQ execution context before making changes.
  - Resolve deploy strategy via the Deployment Strategy Contract.
  - Perform the required git/deploy steps for `direct_commit`, `feature_branch`, or `none`. Follow the `Deployment Strategy Contract` section.
  - Do not stop for user approval or separate conversational design/spec loops mid-run.
- Else If user objective start with `review`:
  - Run verification (`tests`, `build`, `lint`).
  - Call `preq_review_task` with review notes.
  - Do not request additional user approval or switch into a separate conversational workflow mid-run.

On any failure in an active task branch, call `preq_block_task` with the blocking reason and stop.
On any failure in a QA branch, update the QA run to `failed` with a concise markdown report and stop.

4. Finalize:
   On success for implementation/review branches, call `preq_complete_task` with summary, branch, and `pr_url` when applicable.
   On success for ask branches, do not call `preq_complete_task`; the successful note rewrite ends after `preq_update_task_note` plus `preq_update_task_status` using the unchanged workflow status.
   On success for insight branches, stop after the Inbox tasks are created; do not call `preq_complete_task` or mutate existing task workflow state.

## Deployment Strategy Contract (required)

Before any git action, resolve deployment strategy through MCP:

1. Call `preq_get_task <task_id>`.
2. Read `task.deploy_strategy` from the response.
3. If missing, call `preq_get_project_settings <project_key>` and resolve from:
   - `settings.deploy_strategy`
   - `settings.deploy_default_branch`
   - `settings.deploy_auto_pr`
   - `settings.deploy_commit_on_review`
   - `settings.deploy_squash_merge`

Expected values from PREQSTATION backend:

- `strategy`: `direct_commit` | `feature_branch` | `none`
- `default_branch`: string (usually `main`)
- `auto_pr`: boolean (feature_branch only)
- `commit_on_review`: boolean
- `squash_merge`: boolean (direct_commit only)

Default when absent/invalid:

- `strategy=none`
- `default_branch=main`
- `auto_pr=false`
- `commit_on_review=true`
- `squash_merge=true`

Behavior by `strategy`:

- `none`: do not run git commit/push/PR. Only code changes + task update result.

- Git-facing artifacts must default to English even when PREQ-facing task updates use another language. This includes commit messages, PR titles, PR bodies, branch names, and other repository-facing metadata.

- `direct_commit`: merge worktree commits into `default_branch` and push. No PR.
  After completing work in the worktree:

  ```bash
  # In primary checkout: update and merge
  git -C <project_cwd> checkout <default_branch>
  git -C <project_cwd> pull origin <default_branch>

  # squash_merge=true (default): single commit
  git -C <project_cwd> merge --squash <worktree_branch>
  git -C <project_cwd> commit -m "<task_id>: <summary>"

  # squash_merge=false: regular merge
  git -C <project_cwd> merge <worktree_branch>

  # Push to remote
  git -C <project_cwd> push origin <default_branch>
  ```

- `feature_branch`: push worktree branch to remote. Create PR only when `auto_pr=true` (requires GitHub access on the agent such as `gh auth` or GitHub MCP).
  ```bash
  git -C <project_cwd> push origin <worktree_branch>
  # if auto_pr=true: create PR via GitHub MCP or gh CLI and capture the PR URL
  ```

PR creation rule for `feature_branch + auto_pr`:

- Default to a non-draft PR.
- Do not create a draft PR unless the user explicitly asked for a draft PR, or the task is intentionally being handed off in an incomplete/blocked state.
- If the available GitHub tool or CLI flow creates a draft PR by default, immediately convert it to "ready for review" before calling `preq_complete_task`.
- Always capture the final non-draft PR URL that will actually be reviewed.

Rule for `commit_on_review`:

- if `true` and strategy is `direct_commit` or `feature_branch`, do not move task to `ready` until remote push is verified.
- if `false`, ready transition is allowed without mandatory remote push.

Required completion rule for `feature_branch + auto_pr + commit_on_review`:

- Treat both the pushed branch name and the PR URL as required before `preq_complete_task`.
- Preferred order:
  1. push `worktree_branch`
  2. create a non-draft PR
  3. if a draft PR was created implicitly, convert it to ready for review
  4. capture the PR URL
  5. call `preq_complete_task` with both `branchName` and `prUrl`
- If GitHub access is unavailable, branch push fails, PR creation fails, or the PR URL cannot be captured, call `preq_block_task` with the exact missing prerequisite and the next operator action.
- Good block reasons are concrete, for example:
  - `Auto PR required before ready, but gh is not authenticated on the coding agent. Run gh auth login or configure GitHub MCP, then resume.`
  - `Auto PR required before ready, but gh pr create failed after pushing task/proj-123/example. Fix the GitHub error and resume.`
  - `Auto PR required before ready, but the PR is still a draft. Mark it ready for review, capture the final PR URL, then resume.`

## Shell Helper Mode (Optional)

If MCP is unavailable, source `scripts/preqstation-api.sh` and use the shell helpers documented in `docs/shell-helper-mode.md`.
Keep SKILL.md focused on lifecycle rules; use the helper reference doc for function signatures and `jq`/curl notes.

## Debug Progress Mode (Optional)

Use this only when the caller explicitly asks for `debug` mode or requests progress visibility.

- File path: `<worktree>/preqstation-progress.md`
- Purpose: local human-readable progress artifact for the current run
- Scope: current run only; refresh it at run start instead of appending infinite history
- Safety: do not use it as lifecycle source of truth, and do not commit or push it unless the user explicitly asks

Write down the current execution flow steps
